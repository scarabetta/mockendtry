# mockendtry

This is an empty repository just to try Mockend.com, a handy GraphQL mock very easy to install:

Go to the [Mockend site](http://mockend.com) and follow the instructions, you have to configure Mockend app in one or more of your repositories. <br/>
**NOTE**: Verify that you select a *PUBLIC* repo!

Once you have the `.mockend.json` file copied into your repo, go to `https://mockend.com/<org>/<repo>/graphql` and play with GraphiQL to assert it's working.

Try mine (this repo with just a single tiny file):  https://mockend.com/scarabetta/mockendtry/graphql
