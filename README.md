# mockendtry

This is an empty repository just to try Mockend.com, a handy GraphQL mock very easy to install:

Go to http://mockend.com and follow the instructions, you have to configure Mockend app in one or more of your repositories. **NOTE**: Verify that you select a PUBLIC repo!

Once you have the .mockend.json file copied into your repo, go to https://mockend.com/<org>/<repo>/graphql and play with GraphiQL to assert it's working.

For example:  https://mockend.com/scarabetta/mockendtry/graphql
